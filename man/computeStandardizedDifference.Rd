\title{Compute standardized difference of mean for all covariates.}
\usage{
computeStandardizedDifference(covariateData1, covariateData2)
}
\arguments{
\item{covariateData1}{The covariate data of the first cohort. Needs to be in aggregated format.}

\item{covariateData2}{The covariate data of the second cohort. Needs to be in aggregated format.}
}
\value{
A data frame with means and standard deviations per cohort as well as the standardized difference
of mean.
